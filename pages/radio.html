            <h2>A Brief Background</h2>
			<p>I have always dreamed of owning a radio station. In late 2021, I started an online radio station that streams through Live365.com.</p>

			<p>About a year after that, I created a website for my station so I could embed the radio player there and blog about songs, music artists, and other music topics. It has been hard to keep up with the blog lately due to work and school requirements, but I want to start back up again soon.</p>

			<p>I like many types of music, but I think my favorite style is 80s, 90s, and early 2000s Christian rock. Last year, I bought a $1 sampler CD highlighting artists from the 80s and 90s that I had never heard of before; I ended up liking a lot of them and buying the full albums. (That was the most expensive $1 I ever spent!) As time permits, I will add many of my new songs to my station.</p>
			
			<p>Feel free to check out the music!</p>
			
			<p>Note: The player itself works great, but the timing of the "Last Played" and "Now Playing" information is sometimes off or glitchy, especially if it is running for a while. Since the player is provided by a third party, I do not have much control over it, but sometimes refreshing the page helps.</p>
