			<p>Hi, I'm Amanda!</p>
			<p>I am currently the IT and Branch Supervisor for a public library in Northwest Indiana. In order to retain that position, I need to obtain a Master's degree in Library and Information Science. I started working on that in January 2024 and am specializing in Public Librarianship. I hope to graduate in Spring or Summer of 2026.</p>
			<p>Back in December 2021, I started out as a part-time circulation clerk here at my public library. When we joined the Evergreen Indiana consortium about a year later, our transit load greatly increased, and I was asked to help our established transit person with the heavier load. We also began adding barcodes to our magazine collection at that time, so I was recruited to copy catalog those.</p>
			<p>Now I am our tech troubleshooter and the go-between for technology needs. If I can figure it outâ€”great! If not, it's my job to contact the people and companies who can. I will eventually be training for some administrative responsibilities as well.</p>
			<p>Before I worked at the library, I worked jobs in food service and retail. I like to stay busy, and I enjoy challenges! (Reasonable challenges, that is!)</p>
			<p>In March 2021, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Thomas Edison State University (TESU), specializing in Entrepreneurship. I tested out of most of my required classes using CLEP, DSST (Dantes), and TECEP (TESU's test option), leaving only four classes for me to complete online. Needless to say, I am very familiar with online learning and with independent studying.</p>
			<p>I enjoy spending time wih my family and <a href="pages/pets.html">my cat</a>, reading books, watching old TV shows, listening to music, and finding music to add to <a href="pages/radio.html">my online radio station</a>. I would also love to play music. I played piano a long time ago, and I'd like to get back into that. I also would like to learn guitar and drums. </p>
			<p>It is fun to meet other library students and workers in my classes. I am excited about my professional journey ahead!</p>
